# 🔧 AgriTrace Fixes Applied

## 🎯 **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### ✅ **1. Dashboard Not Visible**
**Problem**: Dashboard was using only mock data and not connecting to backend API
**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added dashboard API endpoint to backend (`/api/dashboard/:address`)
- ✅ Updated frontend to fetch data from backend API with fallback to mock data
- ✅ Fixed dashboard data structure to include `monthlyComparison`

### ✅ **2. Escrow Creation Failing**
**Problem**: Marketplace escrow creation was not showing in transactions
**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated contract addresses to use correct deployed addresses
- ✅ Fixed environment variables to use Hiro API endpoints
- ✅ Added proper error handling and loading states
- ✅ Fixed purchase flow to properly reset loading state

### ✅ **3. Product Batches Not Reflecting**
**Problem**: Products page was using mock data instead of backend API
**Solution**:
- ✅ Updated products page to fetch from backend API (`/api/batches`)
- ✅ Added proper data transformation between API and UI formats
- ✅ Updated backend to return products in correct format
- ✅ Added fallback to mock data if API fails
