# AgriTrace: Complete Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

AgriTrace is a production-ready decentralized application built on the Stacks blockchain that provides complete transparency and traceability for agricultural supply chains. The system ensures fair compensation for farmers through secure STX escrow payments and immutable tracking from farm to consumer.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Clarity)
- **farmer-registry.clar**: Manages farmer registration, verification, and statistics
- **product-tracking.clar**: Tracks product batches through supply chain stages with immutable history
- **payment-escrow.clar**: Handles secure STX payments with automatic release upon delivery confirmation

### Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- REST API interfacing with Stacks blockchain via Hiro API
- Real-time transaction monitoring and status updates
- QR code generation for product traceability
- Off-chain caching for improved performance

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
- Responsive web application with Tailwind CSS
- Stacks.js wallet integration for seamless blockchain interactions
- Real-time dashboard with supply chain visualization
- Mobile-compatible interface for field use

## 🔧 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Check contract syntax
npm run check

# Run contract tests
npm test

# Deploy to testnet
npm run deploy:testnet

# Start development servers
npm run dev:backend    # Terminal 1
npm run dev:frontend   # Terminal 2

# Build for production
npm run build:frontend
npm run start:backend
npm run start:frontend
```

## 🌐 Network Configuration

### Testnet (Development)
- **Network**: Stacks Testnet
- **API**: https://stacks-node-api.testnet.stacks.co
- **Explorer**: https://explorer.stacks.co/?chain=testnet
- **Faucet**: https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox/faucet?chain=testnet

### Mainnet (Production)
- **Network**: Stacks Mainnet
- **API**: https://stacks-node-api.mainnet.stacks.co
- **Explorer**: https://explorer.stacks.co/

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Development (Testnet)
- Contract deployment: Free (testnet STX)
